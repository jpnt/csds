# csds - C Simple Data Structures

## Overview

**csds** is a C library focused on providing simple, robust implementations of 
fundamental data structures. Designed with clarity and ease of use in mind, this
library aims to serve as a solid foundation for building various applications.

## Data Structures

### Sequences:

- [x] **Vec** (Dynamic Array)
  - Can also be used as a stack or a queue.

- [ ] **DLList** (Doubly Linked List)

### Maps:

- [ ] **HMap** (Hash Table)

- [ ] **BTreeMap** (Balanced Binary Search Tree)

### Miscellaneous:

- [ ] **BHeap** (Binary Heap)
  - Suitable for implementing a Priority Queue.

## Non-Goals

- No "sort" functions

- No "get" funtions

## Goals

- **Robust:**
  - Provide a solid base for building applications with confidence.

- **Simple:**
  - Do few things and do them well, prioritizing ease of understanding and usage.
